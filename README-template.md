## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Continued development

- I used CSS Grid in this challenge. But I am not sure I've used the best practise. Cause when the window shrink, the page is a little weird.
- The color border in the left and right top of each card is a little weird. I will see how other people do and optimize it later.
